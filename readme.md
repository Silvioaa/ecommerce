# E-commerce Application

My name is Silvio Acevedo and I'm a Fullstack Developer. I created this application to show my knowledge and skill in web development. It was created using React, ASP.NET Core and MySql.

## Application's URL

The web page is published and can be accessed in [https://ecommerce.silvioacevedo.space](https://ecommerce.silvioacevedo.space).

## Installation

The application won't run when installed locally yet, as the creation of the MySql database through running the corresponding dump file has not been implemented (it will be soon). 

To clone this repository, open a bash or cmd terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Silvioaa/ecommerce.git
```
### ASP.NET Core

To run the ASP.NET Core application you can open the Ecommerce.sln file with Visual Studio and run the application from there. You can also run it from a cmd terminal or a bash terminal, by accessing the dotnet/Ecommerce folder and running:

```bash
dotnet watch run
```
### React

Before running the react application, you first need to [install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) in your machine, if it has not been installed already. 

In order to run the react application, you first need to open a cmd or bash terminal, access the react folder and run the following command to install all the application's dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the react application with the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```
